        <h2>Foundations Core Skills</h2>
        <article>
            <h3>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>I have learnt that I hold myself back a lot. I think I am not good enough and then proceed to prove to myself why this is true. I have learnt to notice this and am working on changing my self-talk around this to become more encouraging and using ‘not yet’ kind of language.</li>
                <li>I have learnt that positive self talk and belief in self are very important for me if I want to feel great and open to learn new things. </li>
                <li>I have learnt that having breaks when I start to get into a bad way of thinking and doing something else for a bit is an incredibly helpful tool to get myself more motivated and onboard with what I am wanting myself to do. </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>What is the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
            <p>
                Being able to work in a team, communicate well and be understanding of others is a valuable skill to have in programming as well as knowing oneself. Having good self awareness around how I learn can be an invaluable tool to success in not only programming but also throughout my life. 
            </p>
            <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
           <p>
                How I have learnt quite a lot about myself and already have some really great processes in place to get myself to do the things I want to do and know how to entice myself to do this. Also, how keeping myself open and positive makes such a difference to the amount of things I can learn and also how much is can affect my perspective on things. 
           </p>
            <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Getting myself to persist with learning when I was lost and confused. </li>
                <li>Asking for help</li>
                <li>Staying focused</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3>
            <p>
                I think that EDA is wanting to create a different culture in the programming industry and core learning is a big part of that difference. Teaching people from the get go about how important these things are when their brains are open to learning is a great way to spread the seed of change. 
            </p>
            <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
            <p>
                No, I love learning these things. I have found that the more I grow these skills the better all round I become. This impacts the way I interact with others and approach new projects and challenges. The more I know about myself and understand and have empathy for others the faster and better I am at learning as I have less mental blocks/challenges along the way. Thanks EDA for being different and making a positive change in the world.
