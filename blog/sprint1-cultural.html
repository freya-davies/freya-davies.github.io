            <h1>My Learning Plan</h1>
            <article>
                <p>
                    I don’t really know what my long term goals are or what my career pathway looks like but I do know that I would like to:
                    <br> * Have the skills to be able to work as a coder in a creative environment where one of the workplace values is caring for the environment or positive change in the world somehow. 
                    <br> * Have the flexibility to work 3-4 days a week if I want to or perhaps in chucks. 
                    <br><br>
                    While being at EDA I would like to get better at speaking in front of a group, not being as anxious about being with new people, be better at lowering my self-expectations and get to know myself at a deeper level. 
                    <br><br>                    
                    I think I am a good communicator, a great listener and have some awesome human skills. Some limitations in myself would be that I don’t have much experience or knowledge in coding, am not used to sitting down and being on the computer for long periods of time, find reading, writing and spelling challenging as I am a bit dyslexic especially when I am stressed, not used to doing one thing all day (I haven’t had a job for a few months) and my self-belief. 
                    <br><br>                    
                    In regards to the strengths and limitations I have noted above, I will manage my workload and self during DEV Academy’s course well because:
                    <br> * I like rules and have given myself a schedule to be able to keep up with the current workload, I think this will be very useful as time goes on including getting myself used to being in front of a computer for long periods of time. 
                    <br> * I know I get overwhelmed and start to shut down when I get quite stressed which doesn't help with being able to read properly, I currently and will continue to do things I know that are good for me to combate that like exercise, eating healthy, quiet me times, breathing techniques to stay calm, cooking, seeing friends and talking about things that come up with trusted friends. 
                    <br> * I know that if I am feeling good in myself then I can do anything, work with anyone and make things an enjoyable and productive experience.
                    <br> * I have been practising NVC for a number of years now and find this a very useful skill to have, especially when I find myself in heated or challenging situations. I also find that it makes great situations wonderful times too.
                    <br> * I value and respect other people’s opinions and will use my communication and listening skills to be able to work cohesively with other students, staff and others who I may come in contact with. 
                    <br> * To summarise; I will stick to the schedule I have made, continue my self care regime talk to others when I notice things start to get on top of me, I will use my wonderful skills of NVC to sort out any issues and respect and value others as the wonderful human beings that they are.
                    <br><br>
                     I love asking questions and will direct these to the people I think are most appropriate for the situation at hand when I am in need of help. For example for technical questions, google, Slack groups, facilitators and for other matters, other students, facilitators, friends, my counselor. 
                     <br><br>
                     What I am expecting from the facilitation team is:
                     <br> * To have a check-in with Joseph every week during Foundations
                     <br> * To be supported in my learning journey by being supplied with work and challenges, help with technical questions, have a space to go to to work which is conducive for learning, be held accountable for deadlines and keeping up with the workload
                     <br> * Have some understanding and a listening ear to say if I am not dealing with things well
                     <br><br>
                    Currently the only other commitment I have that is not that flexible is Thursday afternoon/evening every second week to pack and collect food from the co op I am apart of. In saying this, it is also quite flexible.
