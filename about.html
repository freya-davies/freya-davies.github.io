        <h2>Hello!</h2>
        <p>My name is Freya and I live in around the south coast of Wellington. <br><br>
            Sprint 1's Core work has provoked thought about what things I actually value in myself and others such as honesty, integrity, listening, order and fun. Reflecting on these things has grown a new appreciation and given me something else to notice and enjoy everyday.<br>
            It has also highlighted things I struggle with which is useful to acknowledge and keep in mind when coming up against a challenge so I can respond in an understanding way towards myself. <br><br>
            I am attending Dev Academy because I love learning, want to up-skill myself so I can have more flexibility and freedom in my life, allow me to be involved in awesome projects and to be able to further my passion for environmental sustainability via funds. I am also taking this course because I know it will be a huge challenge for me for multiple reasons and I want to prove to myself that I can do it.
