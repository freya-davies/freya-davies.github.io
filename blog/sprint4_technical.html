        <h2>Problem Solving</h2>
        <article>
            <h3>When I got blocked on a simple problem...</h3>
            <p>
                I was tired and I knew it. I had been staring at the same problem <em>why was my capitalize function returning the words twice, once capsed and once original?</em>
                and cycling round the same options of solutions that I already knew didn't work for a good 10 minutes or so. I was feeling irked.
                <br><span style="color: indigo">That's when it happened.</span>
                <br>My timer went off, I woke up slightly from my code filled daze, drank some water and went for a jog down the street and back. 
                On my arrival back home I felt alive and energised, ready to go. I sat back at my desk, set the timer again and asked myself what 
                I was going to do by the time it went off again. The answer was this: google my problem and read carefully so I understand, look at a few 
                different sites and try the things out. If no luck still then ask my question on Slack but before sending it take a minute to reflect on it, maybe go to the toilet 
                or have more water. If still no answer then post message. I then received some helpful clues and tips to solve the problem. Yay, success!! 
                <br>I learnt that having a timer on is a wonderful check-in point and way to stop the hours going by so fast. I also learnt that the input to the 
                function was wrong and returning that AND the correct input minus the first letter. Learnt a lot more about what not to do which will come in 
                handy to remind me when I am doing those things again... hopefully. 
            </p>
            <h3>When I solved a problem in an elegant way...</h3>
            <p>
                This morning I woke up. It was sunny and I felt excited to get into studying because during my half slumber time before my alarm went off again, 
                my brain had come up with the solution to the problem I was working on the night before. All I had to do was stop working on it, tuck myself in 
                and have a good old rest, that's my new favourite kind of problem solving technique and look forward to using it again in the future. 
                How did I feel? Well rested, delighted and proud of my brain and all that it does for me. I learnt that leaving my computer and giving 
                myself space to think can be a great way to solve problems.
            </p>
            <h3>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</h3>
            <p>
                <span style="color: indigo">Pseudocode</span> Okay, 5/10, maybe even a 6. I like that it gives clues about how to solve the test. 
                <br><span style="color: indigo">Trying something</span> Yup, trying and trying more, I'm all over that, 8/10 for that.
                <br><span style="color: indigo">Rubber ducky method</span> I've been talking to my drink bottle and outloud to myself, has been working well for me. 
                When my flatmate came out of his room he was confused as he swore I was having a conversation with someone but no one else was there. I explained myself, don't worry.
                <br><span style="color: indigo">Reading error messages</span> hum, maybe a 3.5/10. Sometimes I just don't know what it is saying or where that extra curly bracket is. 
                <br><span style="color: indigo">Console.logging</span> Oh console.log my friend who sees what's actually going on so well. Feeling well acquainted and confident, 10/10.
                <br><span style="color: indigo">Googling</span> 8/10, I am getting better at refining my question and finding the pages that will give me the info I need relatively quickly. 
                Could definitely get better at all of these things.
                <br><span style="color: indigo">Asking your peers for help</span> Have been doing this, even my flatmate who is interested but has no coding experience. 
                Could ask more or quicker, I don't want to ask all the time and I want myself to get the answer and do it myself. 
                <br><span style="color: indigo">Asking coaches for help</span> Have done this a few times. Very useful especially over a video call as Jo$eph explains it 
                well and I can ask small questions to make sure I'm understanding it correctly.
                <br><span style="color: indigo">Improving your process with reflection</span> only a 5/10 for this one. By the time I go to write my end of day reflection 
                I am tired and wanna get away from the computer. I do think about the things and how they work while doing other things, does mental reflection count?
