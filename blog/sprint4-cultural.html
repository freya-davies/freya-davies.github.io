        <article>
    
            <h1>Research Neuroplasticity</h1>
            <h3>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h3>
            <p>
                By understanding that you’re brain is forever growing, changing and learning you can allow yourself to be able to work with your brain consciously to be able to get the outcomes you want easier than when thinking that you cannot change or do something. The power of belief is incredible, and the amazingness of the brain and the control it has over the body, mind and more never ceases to amaze me. 
                <br><br>Neuroplasticity is a proven idea that the power of the brain is incredible. Incredible because when practising something in our head or reflecting on something strengthens and builds neural pathways which means that the next time this is done or thought about the brain is more easily able to do the thing. This is done by thought power, belief, reflection and practice. As explained in the video Bio Neuroplasticity and Learning Imagination and action use the same neural pathways, so imagining you are lifting weights and actually lifting weights both have an effect of increasing muscle mass, wow. 
            </p>
            <h3>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</h3>
            <p>
                In regards to learning coding, I will use this technique by imagining how code goes over in my head when not at a computer and thinking about a problem that occurred and what I can do differently next time. I will also remind myself of how important it is to believe that I can do it, it just takes time and practise. 
            </p>
            <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity</h3>
            <p>
                Practise lots, either physically or mentally imagining doing the task, both of these ways strengthens neural pathways. Talking and reflecting about the task. 
            </p>
            <h3>Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.</h3>

                I love watching and feel very inspired by Derren Brown, here are some links:

            <h1>Research Growth Mindset</h1>
            <h3>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</h3>
            <p>
                Growth Mindset is the understanding that people can change their ways of thinking to enable them to achieve and learn at a higher level while being engaged, enthused and excited about the process and the challenges that come. It is in the minds belief that the person can or cannot which is what holds them back from learning and taking on challenges. I really enjoyed Carol Dwecks TED Talk The power of believing you can improve in which she talks about studies she has done with children around the USA and the uplifting results that she got from introducing the idea of growth mindset to them. In her talk she says about using the words not yet instead of can’t or didn’t which creates encouragement in oneself and therefore an open and eager mind to try again and continue learning. This is also done by praising the action of effort, perseverance, strategies, improvement and processes. Studies show that when people understand that the brain works like this they are able to learn quicker, have more self belief and more motivation when things get challenging. 
                <br><br>This is relevant to studying just like neuroplasticity because it allows a person to be open to all the learning and possibilities of growth that that entails. 
            </p>
            <h3>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you? How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>
            <p>
                I had looked at this material in the prep work and loved it. At the time I was surprised and not surprised about how powerful the brain is. What’s changed would be me being more conscious of these things and reminding myself when I find things challenging that it is a fun game of growing and that I am very capable of doing it, just need to practise. 
            </p>
            <h3>Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.</h3>
            <p>
                I really enjoyed Carol Dwecks TED talk as I mentioned above which reinforced why having a growth mindset is so valuable.

            <h1>Blend with your learning plan and strategies</h1>
            <h3>Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.</h3>
            <p>
                Well, I had already learnt about this in the prep work before I wrote my learning plan, so I don’t think it will change too much now but if I hadn't done it in prep then I think it would affect the plan a lot.
