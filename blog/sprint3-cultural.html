        <h1>Core: EQ and IQ</h1>
        <article>
            <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
            <p>
                Emotional intelligence is:
            </p>
            <ul class="alignLeft">
                <li>Being conscious of the present moment</li>
                <li>Tuning in with body whether it be breath or sensation. </li>
                <li>Understanding others emotions and being about to what things are yours and what things are theirs</li>
                <li>Knowing oneself and being understanding to self</li>
                <li>Noticing feelings and thoughts as they come up, greeting them with curiousity instead of reacting to them</li>
                <li>Changing negative thought patterns into useful positive ones</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>How is it different to IQ?</h2>
            <p>
                Intellectual intelligence is understanding the facts and concepts behind ideas or facts. This doesn’t involve emotions at all and is more technological and uses different parts of the brain than emotional intelligence. 
            </p>
            <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
            <p>
                Both EQ and IQ are important in understanding and learning in life. I think EQ is important in more of a holistic way, it creates understanding, acceptance among differences, connection with others and connects to a deep part of a human's needs like being seen, heard and understood to name a few. It makes it easier to manage and interact with other humans.
                <br>In a job context being mindful and having EQ is a desirable trait as it is more conducive for teamwork and ease and understanding in the workplace. This means someone that has a higher EQ makes them more hireable.
