            <h1>Identity, Values and Strengths</h1>
            <article>
                <p> 
                    <h2>1 - Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values</h2>
                    <h3>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h3>
                        <br>I used to have a job in a company which sold products where came from sweatshops in china. These products were of low quality, the people who made them were not getting paid much at all and their working conditions were probably not great either. Ethically, this didn’t sit well with me as I realised that I have a strong value for equality, and respect for both the planet and for people. On the other hand I worked with some great friends, was getting a need for growth and order met, and I was reliant on that job for money to pay for rent and food. It was then my choice to decide what to do next. After a few months I decided that my values for equality and respect out weighed the others and I left that job. This meant that I had to find a way to meet those needs another way, I traded my car for a van and some money so I could then live in the van which gave me space to plan my next move according to my values. 
                        <br><br>
                    <h3>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity</h3>
                        <br>In general, I think the culture I have grown up in values people for the time they spend doing things for money, the way they look and the possessions they have. This has influenced me in lots of ways, many of which have been negative however I like to believe that there are always great learnings and growth from the negative things in life. Because I do not agree with lots of society's values it pushes me to really investigate what is true for me and what I really value and appreciate. I personally like to spend a lot of time caring for people and the planet in different ways (making food, listening, checking in with people about challenging times they’ve had, gardening, eating local and organic) but these things are not usually paid for, I wear my messy clothes and the reward I receive is an inner feeling of warmth. I guess because I don’t agree with these things it sparks an energy in me to strive to stick to what I value and not get caught up with society's values.

                    <h2> 2 - Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.</h2>
                        I am supportive, reliable, loyal and enthusiastic Imaginative and observant and a keen eye for details, sometimes taken a bit far into perfectionism Loyal and enthusiasm
                        I am great at many things I have realised, listening for example. I have ha Some of my strengths are listening, empathy and support. I love helping people whenever I can and growth, perseverance, 
                        
                    <h3>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h3>
                        I am in charge of organising food for my flat and as we do food together this means that I take in my flatmate’s values and thoughts. This is where my strengths of listening, communication, creativity, order and systems comes in. One decision we made was about where we were getting our veggies from. I researched a number of options that would keep in with existing values, and over dinner discussed these options enthusiastically. I listened and received feedback on these and set in place a system that would work efficiently and that took into consideration peoples options. Some consequences are that I spend time ordering, sorting and collecting the food and reconciling accounts, but we get organic, local food while being part of a community with shared values.

                    <h3>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</H3>
                        <br>Growing up in a culture that's idea of woman having a role of carer, supporter, and house keeper has influenced me a lot. While I disagree with the stereotype, I think it has grown a strength of care and support for others in me and on the flip side grown a belief of not deserving to be able to support and back myself.
                        <br><br>
                    <h3>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h3>
                        <br><b>Strengths;</b> organising, systematic thinking, planning, communication, listening eye for detail, creative, imaginative.
                        <br><b>Limitations;</b> perfectionism, emotional, sometimes take things personally, not accept help easily, have high expectations for myself. 
                        <br><br>
                    <h3>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</h3>
                        <br>I am a strong organiser and systematic thinker and have an eye for detail which comes in handy when planning and understanding the learning however a limitation of that is sometimes being a perfectionist and having high standards for myself which can be detrimental to me confidence and workflow. 
                        <br>I am a strong communicator and listener which is great for working in a group, discussing problems I am having and to connect with fellow students but the downside of this is that I am sensitive and find it hard to ask for help when I need it.
                        <br><br>
                    <h3>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</h3>
                </p>
                <ul class="alignLeft">
                    <li>I was working on a start up project the other year and had a lot of resistance to my ideas and process with the person I was working with. To try and work things out </li>
                    <li>I met up with them to discuss issues/ideas and get an understanding of why they were resistant, I found this beneficial to understand where he was coming from but not that effective in productivity. </li>
                    <li>I researched about good processes and techniques, and spoke to some people working in that industry, this was useful for productivity as it gave me confidence in the direction I was going and the steps I was taking and gave me evidence to back my ideas to my team member. </li>
                    <li>I also came up with other options to present</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    All of these things were useful but I think not that effective. If I could redo this I would ask more questions at the beginning of what their intention for the project is and get a clear picture of things before starting because then we would both be on the same page, have similar expectations and it would save spending lots of time and effort.
