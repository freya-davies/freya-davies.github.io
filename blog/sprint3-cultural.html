                <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
                <p>
                    Emotional intelligence is:
                </p>
                <ul class="alignLeft">
                    <li>Being conscious of the present moment</li>
                    <li>Tuning in with body whether it be breath or sensation. </li>
                    <li>Understanding others emotions and being about to what things are yours and what things are theirs</li>
                    <li>Knowing oneself and being understanding to self</li>
                    <li>Noticing feelings and thoughts as they come up, greeting them with curiousity instead of reacting to them</li>
                    <li>Changing negative thought patterns into useful positive ones</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>How is it different to IQ?</h2>
                <p>
                    Intellectual intelligence is understanding the facts and concepts behind ideas or facts. This doesnâ€™t involve emotions at all and is more technological and uses different parts of the brain than emotional intelligence. 
                </p>
                <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
                <p>
                    Both EQ and IQ are important in understanding and learning in life. I think EQ is important in more of a holistic way, it creates understanding, acceptance among differences, connection with others and connects to a deep part of a human's needs like being seen, heard and understood to name a few. It makes it easier to manage and interact with other humans.
                    <br>In a job context being mindful and having EQ is a desirable trait as it is more conducive for teamwork and ease and understanding in the workplace. This means someone that has a higher EQ makes them more hireable.
